**年份**: 2023
**分类**: ecommerce_evaluation

**创新点**: This research paper addresses one of the most challenging problems in recommender systems: the user cold-start issue in the matching stage. The authors, from Tencent and Tsinghua University, propose a novel architecture called Cold & Warm Net that dynamically handles both cold-start users (new users with minimal interaction history) and warm-up users as they accumulate behavioral data.

**实验结果**:
