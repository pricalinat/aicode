  "summary": "This research paper addresses the critical challenge of accurate retail sales forecasting, which is essential for inventory management and strategic planning. The authors implement and compare multiple machine learning models—Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and XGBoost—using the Favorita Stores dataset from Ecuador, which contains sales data across 54 stores and 33 product families. The study focuses on leveraging hyperparameter tuning through RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to optimize model performance, with particular emphasis on capturing complex seasonality and non-linear relationships inherent in retail sales data.\n\nThe optimized Random Forest model achieved remarkable results, with an R-squared value of 0.945, representing a substantial improvement over the traditional LR model (R-squared: 0.531) and the initial RF model (R-squared: 0.915). The model reduced the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) to 1.172, demonstrating superior predictive capability compared to other state-of-the-art models including Gradient Boosting (R-squared: 0.942), SVR (R-squared: 0.940), and XGBoost (R-squared: 0.939). The tuned RF model explained 94.5% of the variance in sales, a 2.8% improvement over the initial RF model, while maintaining the lowest MSE (79,564.47) and MAE (134.62) among all compared models.\n\nThe methodology involved comprehensive data preprocessing including missing value handling, duplicate removal, and one-hot encoding of categorical variables. Feature engineering extracted temporal predictors such as day of week, month, and year to capture seasonal patterns, along with lag features and interaction terms to account for temporal dependencies. The optimal RF hyperparameters identified through GridSearchCV included 120 estimators and a maximum depth of 12. Residual analysis revealed stable mean residuals around zero with some heteroscedasticity observed post-2015, indicating the model's strong handling of large sales volumes while noting increased variability at higher predicted values.\n\nThe research highlights the importance of advanced ML techniques in predictive analytics for retail forecasting, demonstrating that ensemble methods like Random Forest significantly outperform traditional statistical approaches when dealing with complex, high-dimensional sales data. The findings underscore the necessity of hyperparameter optimization and comprehensive model evaluation using multiple metrics including R-squared, MSE, RMSE, MAE, and RMSLE. Future work should explore incorporating external variables such as promotions, holidays, and economic factors, while also investigating deep learning approaches like LSTM networks and hybrid models for potentially improved forecasting accuracy.",
