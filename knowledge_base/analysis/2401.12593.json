  "summary": "# MOReGIn: Multi-Objective Recommendation at the Global and Individual Levels\n\nThis academic paper addresses a significant gap in recommender systems research: the simultaneous optimization of both global-level and individual-level objectives. The authors present MOReGIn (Multi-Objective Recommendation at the Global and Individual Levels), a novel post-processing approach that regulates recommendation lists to achieve both perspectives while preserving recommendation effectiveness.\n\n## Problem Statement and Research Gap\n\nTraditional recommender systems primarily focus on accuracy, but modern platforms must balance multiple objectives beyond relevance, including diversity, calibration, and fairness. The authors identify that existing Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs) operate at either the global level (ensuring system-wide properties like provider exposure) or the individual level (tailoring results to each user's preferences), but never both simultaneously. This creates a critical limitation when platforms require both system-wide fairness and personalized calibration.\n\nThe paper demonstrates through experimental analysis that when these two perspectives coexist, standard approaches fail to guarantee either objective effectively. Users tend to rate items of specific genres produced in certain geographic regions, indicating that genre preferences and provider provenance are inherently connected phenomena.\n\n## The MOReGIn Approach\n\nThe proposed solution uses a bucket-based post-processing strategy that combines item genres with the continent of production for each provider. This approach addresses provider fairness as the global objective (ensuring equitable representation of providers from different continents across all recommendations) and genre calibration as the individual objective (matching each user's genre preferences observed in their training data).\n\nThe algorithm operates in four main steps. First, it computes the representation of each demographic group (continent) in the training data. Second, it calculates each user's genre propensity based on their rating history. Third, it creates a unified bucket structure pairing continent-genre combinations, storing predicted items in relevant buckets. Fourth, it performs three-phase re-ranking: Phase 1 applies hard constraints ensuring both continental representation and genre calibration thresholds are met; Phase 2 relaxes genre constraints while maintaining continental representation; Phase 3 selects highest-rated remaining items to fill the recommendation list.\n\n## Datasets and Experimental Validation\n\nThe authors addressed data scarcity by extending the MovieLens-1M dataset to include continent of production for each movie via OMDB APIs, and collected a novel dataset called BeyondSongs containing 1,777,981 ratings for 16,380 songs with artist provenance and 14 music genres. Both datasets are publicly available.\n\nExperiments evaluated five collaborative filtering algorithms (ItemKNN, UserKNN, BPRMF, SVDpp, and NeuMF) against three comparison approaches: the original recommendations (OR), a calibration-only baseline (CL), and a provider fairness baseline (PF). Results demonstrate that MOReGIn achieves near-zero disparate visibility across all continents and algorithms, substantially outperforming both CL and PF approaches. The algorithm also achieves the lowest miscalibration scores, meaning genre distributions in recommendations best match each user's historical preferences. Regarding recommendation quality, MOReGIn generally maintains NDCG scores comparable to or better than fairness-aware baselines, with minimal accuracy trade-offs for substantially improved fairness and calibration properties.\n\nThe key insight is that calibration and provider fairness are related problems because users' genre preferences correlate with the geographic origin of content producers, making joint optimization both feasible and necessary for responsible recommendation system design.",
