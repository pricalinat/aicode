  "summary": "# Summary\n\nThis academic paper presents a comprehensive security analysis of miniapps, which are lightweight applications embedded within mobile platforms like WeChat. The authors propose a triad threat model that examines security from three perspectives: users, servers, and attackers, guided by the principles of least privilege and privilege consistency. The research is particularly significant given that as of 2019, China had reached 1.4 billion miniapp users with 960 million active users, making security vulnerabilities a matter of considerable scale.\n\nThe authors developed a novel analysis framework combining AppScan, Proxifier, and Windows WeChat client to detect security vulnerabilities in mainstream miniapps. This approach represented an advancement over previous methods that relied on Android emulators and reverse engineering, which had become less effective with WeChat updates. The framework was applied to nearly 1,000 mainstream WeChat miniapps, identifying a total of 50,628 security risk hazards across nine major vulnerability categories.\n\nThe nine categories of vulnerabilities identified span frontend, backend, and other security issues. Frontend vulnerabilities include logic vulnerabilities (such as authentication bypass and CAPTCHA circumvention) and cross-site scripting (XSS). Backend vulnerabilities encompass privilege escalation through parameter manipulation, SQL injection due to inadequate input validation, arbitrary file uploads without proper type checking, and weak password security. Additional categories include sensitive information leakage, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and security issues arising from third-party technology integration. The study found that logic vulnerabilities, XSS, and SQL injection appeared at much higher frequencies in actual testing than their proportional representation in standard security risk analyses.\n\nThe evaluation results revealed 5,456 high-severity issues requiring immediate attention, 4,042 moderate-risk issues, 35,543 low-risk issues, and 5,587 informational recommendations. Specific case studies demonstrated real-world exploitability, such as SQL injection allowing unauthorized database access, privilege escalation via UserId parameter manipulation revealing employee phone numbers, and verification codes like \"111111\" enabling unauthorized registration. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for improvements in interface security, platform security, backend security, and staff training to address these vulnerabilities comprehensively.\n\n*Security risks in miniapps occur across three components at various granularity in different manners.*",
