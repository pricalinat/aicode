  "summary": "# LLM-PKG: Leveraging Large Language Models for Explainable E-commerce Recommendations\n\nThis paper presents LLM-PKG, a novel framework that combines Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs to provide effective and explainable product recommendations in e-commerce. The authors address a critical challenge: traditional product knowledge graph construction is expensive and labor-intensive, requiring expert knowledge to mine implicit relationships between products.\n\n## Problem and Approach\n\nModern e-commerce recommendation systems face the dual challenge of accuracy and explainability. While LLMs possess vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, calling them in real-time is impractical due to response time constraints. The authors propose distilling LLM knowledge into a knowledge graph that can be efficiently queried during online serving.\n\nThe framework operates in two main phases: offline construction and online serving. During offline construction, the system employs LLMs to generate initial product recommendations with rationales by feeding curated prompts containing user behavior context, task descriptions, format indicators, and one-shot learning examples. The LLM outputs recommendations as RDF triples (subject, predicate, object) representing product relationships.\n\n## Key Technical Components\n\nThe prompt design includes four essential components: user behavior injection to contextualize the seed product, task description specifying the recommendation format, format indicator requiring JSON output, and one-shot examples to guide the model toward accurate results. *The one-shot component significantly improves the correctness rate of the output format.*\n\nFollowing initial generation, the framework validates and refines the knowledge graph using LLM evaluation. Nodes receive acceptability scores from 1-10, with those scoring below 6 removed. The system also evaluates recommendation rationales for accuracy, replacing inappropriate explanations with better alternatives.\n\nTo map LLM-generated products to real enterprise inventory, the system employs vector search using fine-tuned BERT embeddings. Product titles are encoded into dense vectors and indexed using K-Nearest Neighbors, enabling semantic matching between knowledge graph nodes and actual products.\n\n## Results and Impact\n\nThe authors conducted A/B testing on an e-commerce website within the sneaker category. The treatment group displayed LLM-PKG recommendations with accompanying rationales (such as \"similar style\" or \"affordable alternative\"), while the control group used existing collaborative filtering methods with category names.\n\nThe experimental results demonstrated significant improvements across all key metrics. Clicks increased by 5.19%, Transactions grew by 7.59% (1-day maturity) and 7.55% (7-day maturity), Click-Through Rate improved by 5.91%, Conversion Rate rose by 7.20%, and Gross Merchandise Bought increased by 8.56%. *Ads revenue showed the largest uplift at +10.84% with statistical significance (p=0.0184).*\n\nThe authors attribute these improvements to two factors: the LLM's ability to understand user needs based on historical behavior for more accurate recommendations, and the explainability provided by rationale messages that attract user engagement. Unlike complexKG-based explanation systems, LLM-PKG simply displays edge information without additional operations, making it efficient and scalable.\n\n## Conclusion and Future Work\n\nThe paper demonstrates that combining LLMs with knowledge graphs effectively addresses both recommendation accuracy and explainability. The framework successfully bridges the gap between LLM capabilities and real-world e-commerce applications through iterative refinement and enterprise product mapping.\n\nFuture work includes building connections between actual users and user groups within the knowledge graph to enable more personalized recommendations, and empirical research on optimizing recommendation strategies based on LLM-PKG performance data.\n\nThis research represents a practical approach to applying LLMs at web scale, offering a viable alternative to real-time LLM inference while maintaining the benefits of explainable AI in recommendation systems.",
