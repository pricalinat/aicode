  "summary": "# Summary: Natural Language Processing in Customer Service\n\nThis systematic review paper examines the application of natural language processing (NLP) technologies in customer service across multiple domains. The study analyzed 26 peer-reviewed papers from 2015 to 2022, using five major scientific databases (IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, Springer, and Google Scholar) following the PRISMA methodology. The research addressed five key questions covering application fields, datasets, evaluation methods, future directions, and limitations of NLP in customer service.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n**Application Fields:** The review identified 10 main application fields where NLP is used in customer service. General customer service applications dominated at 41% of studies, followed by social media (18%) and e-commerce (15%). Additional fields include medical, telecommunications, booking, construction, banking, energy utilities, and marketing. Chatbots and question-answering systems emerged as the primary implementation approaches across these domains.\n\n**Techniques and Methods:** Deep learning and machine learning techniques were most commonly employed. TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) was the most widely used method, followed by Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and LSTM networks. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Seq2Seq approaches were also frequently applied.\n\n**Datasets:** Most researchers used self-created datasets specific to their domains, making \"Others\" the most common dataset category. The Twitter dataset was the second most frequently used, reflecting the prevalence of social media customer service applications. Other notable datasets include Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus, DiDi Dialogue Corpus, and domain-specific collections like eHealthforum QAs and questionDoctor QAs.\n\n**Evaluation Methods:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 measure were the dominant evaluation metrics across the reviewed studies. Additional methods included AUC-ROC curves, BLEU scores, Mean Opinion Score (MOS), cross-validation, and Grice's maxims for qualitative assessment.\n\n## Challenges and Future Directions\n\nThe most significant limitation identified across studies was dataset quality and quantity, which directly impacts model performance. Other limitations included restricted vocabulary (only understanding words in training data), lack of empathy and ethics in chatbot design, and demographic bias in study participants. Nearly 75% of customers have experienced poor customer service, highlighting the importance of improving these systems.\n\nFuture research directions emphasize increasing dataset sizes for better model validation, implementing multilingual and cross-language capabilities, improving emotional intelligence and user experience understanding, and extending applications to more domains like e-commerce and healthcare. The review provides a roadmap for researchers entering this field, identifying gaps in current literature and opportunities for advancement.",
