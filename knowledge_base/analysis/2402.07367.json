  "summary": "This review-copy paper explores whether large language models can help detect privacy leakage in WeChat Mini Programs, a widely used mini-app ecosystem embedded inside WeChat. It frames mini-apps as lightweight, fast, platform-integrated applications that often handle sensitive data such as personal details and payments, making privacy risk detection an important security need. *This paper investigates the potential of employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect privacy breaches within WeChat Mini Programs.*\n\nThe paper motivates LLM-based inspection as a way to scale analysis and leverage contextual understanding, including the idea of extending beyond plain text to multimodal content where applicable. It outlines a workflow that resembles a typical ML pipeline: collecting representative mini-program code or content, preprocessing, selecting and fine-tuning a model, extracting features, optionally fusing multiple modalities, then detecting and evaluating sensitive-information findings with iterative improvement. A small evaluation example asks GPT to scrutinize a WeChat Mini Program JavaScript snippet that processes form inputs and updates user state, and the write-up reports that the code may collect personal data such as name, gender, date of birth, email, and an identifier tied to the user context. *This paper delves into the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect privacy breaches within WeChat Mini Programs.*\n\nKey caveats are emphasized in the discussion, arguing that practical effectiveness depends on overcoming several limitations:\n- Bias and cultural or linguistic mismatch can reduce detection accuracy in China-centered WeChat contexts\n- Content complexity such as encrypted data, multimedia, emoticons, and evolving slang can be hard for models to interpret consistently\n- The platform’s communication patterns change over time, requiring updates and monitoring to avoid degradation\n\nThe related work section situates this idea within broader LLM surveys and a growing body of mini-app security research, referencing prior efforts on resource-management risks, measurements of mini-app ecosystems, bug-pattern detection, identity-confusion issues, hidden APIs, cross-platform API discrepancies, signature verification gaps, and static taint analysis for sensitive data flow. The conclusion reiterates the central claim: LLMs may be a useful tool for identifying privacy breaches in mini-program code, but their value depends on careful evaluation and addressing the stated limitations to improve trustworthiness and reliability.",
