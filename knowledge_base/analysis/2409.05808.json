  "summary": "This paper argues that software testing remains essential to SDLC quality, but traditional test case generation and validation are slowed by manual effort, human error, incomplete coverage, and high maintenance as systems change. It positions AI as a practical response, using machine learning, natural language processing, and related techniques to automate test creation, expand coverage to edge cases, and keep regression testing aligned with fast-moving Agile and DevOps workflows. The stated goal is a comprehensive look at current approaches, tools, and real-world examples, alongside limitations and research gaps.\n\n*The integration of AI in software testing has emerged as a transformative approach, addressing long-standing challenges in test case generation and validation.* AI-driven generation is described in three main threads: ML models that learn from code structure and historical defects to produce risk-focused tests; NLP methods that extract scenarios from requirements and user stories and keep tests updated as requirements evolve; and automated optimization that reduces redundancy via prioritization, minimization, coverage analysis, and data-driven strategies. The survey also highlights commonly cited tool categories and examples for functional and visual testing, adaptive maintenance, and mutation testing, and it emphasizes validation via predictive outcome modeling, anomaly detection, and CI/CD integration, including self-healing tests that adjust when UI or locators change. *Self-healing test cases leverage AI to adapt and update themselves as software evolves, reducing the manual effort required for test maintenance and ensuring ongoing test effectiveness.*\n\nThe case-study section summarizes reported industry use of AI testing in Android development, mobile app reliability, operating system validation across hardware configurations, cloud services, and large-scale e-commerce systems, attributing improvements to faster execution, more consistent results, and broader scenario coverage. At the same time, the discussion and conclusion stress constraints that can limit real-world value: dependence on high-quality and representative training data, bias and fairness risks, model opacity and explainability issues, ongoing retraining needs due to data drift, integration difficulty with legacy systems and existing workflows, costs and skill gaps, and security and privacy concerns when sensitive data is involved. Future directions proposed include tighter DevOps integration for continuous testing, edge and cloud-aware testing, reinforcement and transfer learning, blockchain-based integrity and auditability of test artifacts, and more explainable and ethically grounded AI to support human oversight rather than replace it.",
