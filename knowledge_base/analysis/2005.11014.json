  "summary": "This paper tackles a common bottleneck in building task-oriented chatbots: intent models need many labeled user utterances, but manual intent labeling of past conversation logs is slow and expensive. It proposes an intent mining framework that uses both conversation metadata such as short issue descriptions and the conversations themselves to automatically discover candidate intents, then turns them into labeled training data for supervised intent classification. A key emphasis is handling realistic, skewed intent distributions and situations where the true number of intents is unknown.\n\nThe framework has four main steps: (1) extract intent-bearing utterances from conversations using a domain-agnostic dialog act classifier, (2) cluster similar utterances, (3) have experts label clusters with intent names to create seed data, and (4) propagate labels to the remaining unlabeled utterances using a statistical classifier to produce a final training set. For representations, it uses Universal Sentence Encoder embeddings, and builds a dialog act tagger trained on ATIS with a CRF using POS-based features; when conversation metadata is missing, it also describes ways to derive a short description from raw logs, such as agent intent-clarification questions or top user information or question utterances. The main algorithmic contribution is ITER-DBSCAN, an iterative variant of DBSCAN that repeatedly relaxes density constraints by increasing the distance threshold and decreasing the minimum-points requirement, aiming to find both high-density and low-density clusters in sparse, imbalanced data.\n\nEvaluation spans eight datasets, including a Twitter airline customer support conversation set plus multiple public intent and short-text corpora such as Finance, ATIS, AskUbuntu, Personal Assistant, and others. The paper compares ITER-DBSCAN against DBSCAN and HDBSCAN, and against AV-KMeans on the conversation dataset, using clustering and intent-induction metrics including precision, recall, F1, accuracy for conversations and NMI and ARI for labeled corpora; it reports that ITER-DBSCAN generally identifies more intents and achieves stronger clustering scores, with HDBSCAN failing to find clusters on the airline conversation data. It also discusses practical runtime scaling by partitioning datasets larger than 10K with K-means and running density clustering in parallel, and closes by suggesting future improvements via richer conversational features and neural conversation representations.\n\n*Collecting a substantial coverage of training data is a bottleneck in the bot building process.*\n\n*We introduce an extension to the DBSCAN algorithm and presented a density-based clustering algorithm ITER-DBSCAN for unbalanced data clustering.*",
