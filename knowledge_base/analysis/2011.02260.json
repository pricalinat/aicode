  "summary": "This survey reviews how graph neural networks, or GNNs, are used to build recommender systems by treating core signals as graphs, such as user item interaction bipartite graphs, item transition graphs from behavior sequences, social networks, and knowledge graphs. It argues that GNN message passing can explicitly encode collaborative structure and explore multi hop connectivity, which can improve learned user and item representations beyond classic neighborhood methods and matrix factorization style representation learning. It proposes a taxonomy, summarizes over 100 representative studies, compares design choices and tradeoffs, and closes with open issues and future directions, alongside a consolidated list of common datasets, metrics, and real world deployments.  \n*This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on GNN-based recommender systems.*  \n*We discuss the limitations of current methods and propose nine potential future directions.*\n\nThe taxonomy organizes GNN based recommendation models by the information type and task setting:  \n- User item collaborative filtering on interaction graphs  \n- Sequential recommendation by converting sequences into item transition graphs or hypergraphs  \n- Social recommendation by propagating influence over friend graphs and integrating it with interaction behavior  \n- Knowledge graph based recommendation with relation aware propagation over multi entity, multi relation graphs  \n- Other tasks such as POI, group, bundle, CTR prediction, and multimedia recommendation  \n\nAcross these categories, the survey repeatedly frames model design around a small set of issues. For collaborative filtering it highlights graph construction choices (bipartite vs enriched graphs with added edges, hyperedges, virtual intent nodes, or coarsened hierarchical nodes, plus sampling for scale), neighbor aggregation (equal weighting, degree normalization, attention, central node augmentation, and neighbor interaction modeling), update functions (discarding self vs combining self and neighbor messages, and simplified variants such as removing nonlinearities in LightGCN), and how to form final embeddings (last layer vs pooling or concatenation across layers). For sequential recommendation it focuses on how to build richer sequence graphs when sessions are short, either by incorporating additional sequences or altering the current graph structure, how propagation should respect direction and order (often via GGNN style mechanisms, sometimes attention or order aware aggregation as in LESSR), and how to compute a sequence preference representation (commonly attention over items, sometimes with positional signals or extra sequence modeling layers). For social recommendation it contrasts equal friend influence against attention based weighting and newer attempts to denoise or infer missing social ties, then compares integrating social and interaction signals via separate graphs with late fusion versus unified heterogeneous graphs with hierarchical aggregation. For knowledge graph based recommendation it contrasts building a unified graph that includes users as entities or constructing user item specific subgraphs versus using users as queries to weight relations, and it surveys relation aware attention style aggregators that score triples using entities, relations, and sometimes user context.\n\nThe paper also provides practical reference material: it lists widely used datasets by task, including MovieLens variants, Amazon category subsets, Yelp, Gowalla, Yoochoose, Diginetica, RetailRocket, LastFM, Flickr, Ciao, Epinions, Douban, Book-Crossing, Dianping, and Taobao, and it summarizes common top K and ranking metrics such as Precision, Recall, HR, NDCG, MAP, MRR, AUC, and F1 with definitions for several of them. It notes industry applications at web scale, including Pinterest PinSage, Alibaba deployments such as IntentGC, a WeChat Top Story article recommender using social signals, and incremental learning work for app recommendation. The future directions emphasize user representation that captures diverse and uncertain interests, scalability on billion node graphs, handling dynamic graphs, adaptive receptive field selection, self supervised learning, robustness to noise and attacks, privacy preserving training, fairness, and explainability.",
