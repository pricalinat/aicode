  "summary": "This paper proposes PMTRec, a personalized multi task learning approach for recommender systems that learns more comprehensive user and item embeddings by training the main recommendation objective together with auxiliary tasks derived from other information sources such as social links, item categories, co view and co buy signals, embedding regularizers, or rating regression. The central claim is that standard multi task methods are not well matched to personalized recommendation because different users and items should receive different task weightings, and naive gradient pooling can mix conflicting update directions or drown out tasks with smaller gradient scales. *PMTRec dynamically adjusts task weights based on gradient norms for each user/item*.\n\nPMTRec is framed at the gradient pooling level during backpropagation: it collects per task gradients on each user and item embedding, computes per task norms, then converts those norms into personalized weights via a temperature softmax. It introduces two modules to address recommender specific issues: a task focusing mechanism that increasingly upweights the main RecSys gradient over epochs using an exponential base alpha to reduce harmful orientation drift, and a gradient magnitude balancing mechanism controlled by temperature tau to prevent large norm tasks from dominating. The paper provides a training procedure that stacks gradients, rescales the main task norm by alpha to the epoch, computes softmax weights using tau, and updates the embedding table with the weighted sum.\n\nExperiments on three real world datasets with different scales and auxiliary task designs, Epinion, Amazon Video Game, and Amazon Office, compare PMTRec to multiple multi task baselines including equal weighting and several gradient conflict or weighting methods such as GradDrop, PCGrad, GradVac, CAGrad, Aligned MTL, Nash MTL, and RLW. Results report improvements on top K recommendation metrics like Recall and NDCG at K values including 20 and 40, with PMTRec consistently best across datasets, plus additional tests showing compatibility across different encoders such as MF, NGCF, and LightGCN. The study also includes task level investigations showing that adding auxiliary tasks often helps but can sometimes hurt depending on dataset and task alignment, ablations showing performance drops when removing task focusing or magnitude balancing, sensitivity analyses over alpha and tau, and training curves suggesting PMTRec improves more gradually as it first explores auxiliary tasks and then aligns toward the main task. *This paper introduces PMTRec, a novel multi-task training algorithm specifically designed for recommender systems.*",
