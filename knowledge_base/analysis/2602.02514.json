  "summary": "This paper presents a Whole-Page Experience Optimization framework for modern e-commerce search results pages that mix grid-like organic results with visually distinct widgets, creating non-linear attention patterns that older position-biased list models do not capture. The authors frame page layout selection as a contextual bandit with a composite reward that balances engagement, short-term revenue, and long-term satisfaction, addressing four gaps: multi-objective tradeoffs, delayed reward signals, 2D position-dependent satisfaction, and heterogeneous content types. *the model demonstrated a 1.86% improvement in brand relevance (our primary customer experience metric) while simulta- neously achieving a statistically significant revenue uplift of +0.05%.*\n\nTo quantify long-term satisfaction, they introduce DV-WPX, a causal inference framework that links observable whole-page quality metrics to downstream customer value using quasi-experimental variation within queries, dates, and delivery locations, while controlling for customer history and fixed effects for query and geography. DV-WPX decomposes how page quality impacts 12-week revenue through short-term revenue, short-term engagement, and a direct long-term channel, and estimates effects via Double Machine Learning with de-averaging, cross-fitting, and a residual-on-residual second stage using OLS or LASSO with tuned hyperparameters. They then instantiate DV-WPX as a user satisfaction metric, PR-WP-BMR, which measures brand alignment on brand-sensitive queries by combining pixel-based visual prominence with coarse page regions Top positions 1 to 8, Middle 9 to 16, and Bottom beyond 16, and compares CTR-derived region weights with DV-WPX-derived weights that effectively downweight the Bottom region. *DV-WPX assigns most weight to the Top and Middle regions, with negligible weight on the Bottom.*\n\nThe metric is integrated into a production page template ranker that evaluates eligible templates under business and UI constraints, using Context, Customer, and Content features, separate Bayesian models per objective, and Thompson sampling to score candidates under a normalized weighted sum. Offline, on one day of North America traffic, adding content-aware features improves revenue prediction for both Mobile and Desktop and slightly improves Desktop non-abandonment prediction. Online, in a one-month worldwide A/B test, both satisfaction-aware treatments improve short-term revenue and search CTR, but the DV-WPX-weighted variant also improves long-term revenue while the CTR-weighted proxy slightly declines, supporting the claim that DV-WPX better aligns optimization with long-term customer value; the discussion highlights extensions beyond brand relevance and explores shorter horizons and dynamic region definitions.",
