  "summary": "This March 2020 Master’s thesis from the University of Copenhagen studies how to model on-site user behaviour with machine learning to predict immediate purchase intent for non-life insurance during a single website session. It argues that click and navigation traces can reveal intent more directly than demographic segmentation, and proposes two click-based predictors: an engineered, non-sequential representation trained with a feed-forward neural network, and a sequential representation trained with an RNN using LSTM to preserve temporal order and learn features automatically. *The collection consists of 433,141 sessions of which a purchase occurs in 13.05%.*\n\nThe work uses click-log data from a Danish insurer’s website (May 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018) and defines sessions with a 30-minute inactivity cutoff, limiting to sessions that include e-commerce pages so purchase is possible. Preliminary analysis shows purchase likelihood rises with more pages visited, more distinct pages, and (after a point) higher average time per page, and that intent differs across page categories and product-related sections. Data preparation includes padding or truncating sessions to length 30, binning sparse URL categories, dropping rare click categories, converting timestamps to time-between-interactions, one-hot encoding categorical features, and standardizing numeric features; demographic/time/place features are separately imputed and encoded, including sine-cosine transforms for cyclic time variables.\n\nExperiments compare the two click models to simple baselines (most-frequent, stratified, and a session-length-only model) and to a neural demographic model, using AUC plus balanced accuracy, precision, and recall with thresholds aligned to the class rate. The sequential click model is best (AUC 0.8109, balanced accuracy 0.7011) and beats the engineered click model (AUC 0.7634) and the demographic model (AUC 0.7207), with gains especially in precision and recall; concatenating click and demographic models yields small additional improvement, suggesting partially complementary signals. Focused analyses show both click models struggle on very short sessions, shuffling event order reduces the sequential model AUC by about 3.8 percent, and ablations indicate all feature groups matter, while simple rebalancing (undersampling or oversampling) mainly increases recall with limited AUC benefit. *Our experimental results show that our click-based models significantly outperform the demographic model,* and the thesis closes by outlining future work on reducing click noise, interpretability, additional social data, persuasive personalization, and privacy-aware, legally compliant data handling.",
