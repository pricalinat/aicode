  "summary": "This paper introduces an open research dataset designed to support natural language understanding for e-commerce product search, especially for voice assistants, chatbots, and conversational search. The authors argue that most publicly available e-commerce query data comes from logs and is dominated by short keyword queries, which are shaped by system limitations and do not reflect users full, natural information needs. To address this gap, they present a controlled, crowdsourced collection of 3,540 natural language product-seeking queries across two domains: laptops and jackets, with additional manual annotations to enable NLP and information retrieval research.\n\nThe dataset was collected from 1,818 Prolific participants who were native English speakers and completed the survey on non-mobile devices. Participants wrote free-form descriptions of a desired laptop and a desired jacket under simple scenarios, then provided demographics and self-assessed domain knowledge. After manual filtering for invalid or off-task responses, the final dataset includes 1,754 valid laptop queries and 1,786 valid jacket queries; laptop queries average 35 words (std 20). For annotation, 20 trained annotators labeled laptop queries in Doccano as a sequence-labeling task, marking key facts as product requirements and vague words as ambiguous terms within those facts; each laptop query was annotated by three annotators, and a combined label set retains words agreed on by at least two annotators. Inter-annotator agreement on the laptop set is reported as Krippendorffs alpha 0.697 for key facts and 0.653 for vague words, and a subset of 363 jacket queries has key-fact annotations for cross-domain evaluation.\n\nThe authors provide the dataset publicly under a CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license, with JSONL and CSV releases plus variable descriptions, annotation guidelines, and a Jupyter notebook for loading data, computing statistics, and calculating agreement. They highlight research uses including spelling correction for noisy, colloquial, domain-specific query text; vagueness detection and handling in retrieval, where vague conditions are difficult to map to structured catalog attributes; and attribute mapping from unstructured requirements to structured facets, supporting better product retrieval and interactive clarification. They conclude with planned extensions: fully annotating the remaining jacket queries for both key facts and vagueness, adding cleaned versions of queries with corrected spelling and punctuation, mapping key facts to structured product attributes to build ground truth for facet matching, and linking some queries to relevant products for retrieval experiments.\n\n*We collected and curated a large dataset containing 3,540 natural language queries for two product domains laptops and jackets.*\n\n*This dataset opens up a range of research opportunities in the fields of natural language processing and interactive information retrieval for product search.*",
