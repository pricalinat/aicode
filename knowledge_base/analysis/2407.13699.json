  "summary": "This PDF is a 2017 to 2024 survey of recommender systems that aims to connect algorithmic research with real deployment constraints. It traces the evolution from foundational methods like collaborative filtering, content based filtering, and hybrids to modern approaches using deep learning, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, large language models, and multimodal modeling. It frames recommender systems as end to end pipelines that start with data acquisition and preparation, proceed through training and candidate generation plus ranking, and then rely on evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and feedback loops.\n\n*The primary goal of this survey is to bridge theory with practice.* The paper organizes the field around practical challenges that repeatedly appear across domains: cold start, sparsity, scalability and real time requirements, shifting user preferences, data quality, privacy and security constraints, and the need for diversity, novelty, fairness, transparency, and explainability. It contrasts typical academic constraints like limited access to realistic datasets and over emphasis on accuracy with industry constraints like system scale, latency, and compliance, and it repeatedly highlights why highly complex models may not transfer cleanly into production without substantial adaptation.\n\n*This survey reviews the progress in RS inclusively from 2017 to 2024, effectively connecting theoretical advances with practical applications.* Beyond core model families, it covers specialized areas including context aware, review based, aspect based, explainable and trustworthy systems, and fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics methods, often summarized with large tables of inputs, datasets, metrics, and claimed properties such as scalability and reproducibility. It closes with limitations and future directions that emphasize responsible AI, evaluation beyond accuracy, causal reasoning, on device recommendation to reduce computation and data exposure, and careful use of generative and conversational approaches to improve interaction while managing safety and societal risks.",
