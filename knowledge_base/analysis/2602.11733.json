  "summary": "# Adapting Vision-Language Models for E-commerce Understanding at Scale\n\nThis paper from eBay Inc. and the University of Amsterdam presents a comprehensive approach to adapting general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for e-commerce applications. The research addresses a critical challenge: while VLMs excel at general multimodal tasks, they underperform on e-commerce-specific requirements like extracting product attributes from images, handling multiple product images, and processing noisy seller-generated content.\n\n## Core Problem and Approach\n\nE-commerce product understanding is inherently multimodal, requiring models to analyze text, images, and structured attributes together. General-purpose VLMs like LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen3-VL, and Gemma3 achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse tasks, but translating these capabilities to the e-commerce domain remains challenging. The authors investigate whether high-performing e-commerce VLMs truly require custom LLMs or whether adapting on vision-focused tasks suffices, and determine the best approach for building comprehensive benchmarks.\n\nThe solution involves a three-stage training pipeline following LLaVA-OneVision architecture: Vision-Language Alignment using BLIP-LAION corpus, Mid-Stage Training with mixed datasets, and Visual Instruction Tuning on both general and e-commerce-specific instruction sets. The training data combines approximately 4 million internal e-commerce-oriented instructions with LLaVA-OneVision single-image mixtures, partitioned into Visual Question Answering (45%), Dynamic Attribute Extraction (30%), Precise Instruction Following (12.5%), and Listings (12.5%) tasks.\n\n## Data Curation and Benchmark Development\n\nA significant contribution involves the Visual Verification Pipeline for large-scale data curation. The process collects nearly 15 million raw listings from online marketplaces, captions images through InternVL-2.5-26B, extracts user-supplied item aspects, and employs Mistral-Small-3-24B to verify which aspects can be inferred from the caption and image. This verification ensures visual-textual correspondence during training.\n\nThe authors introduce four e-commerce benchmarks: Aspect Prediction with 2600 general questions across all commerce categories plus 1600 examples each for Fashion with and without additional context; Deep Fashion Understanding with 3000 samples across Apparel Men Shirts, Women Tops, Handbags, and Sneakers subsets; Dynamic Attribute Extraction with 1000 synthetically generated, human-verified examples requiring enumeration of visually grounded attributes without predefined schema; and Multi-image Item Intelligence with 1000 items across categories requiring compilation of regulatory compliance attributes from multiple product images into structured JSON output.\n\n## Experimental Findings\n\nThe experiments reveal several important patterns. E-commerce adapted models substantially outperform general VLMs on domain-specific benchmarks while maintaining strong general-domain performance. When comparing vision encoders, SigLIP2 and Qwen2.5ViT show inconclusive results at lower resolutions, though Qwen2.5ViT's native resolution handling benefits aspect prediction tasks requiring fine image details.\n\nThe text decoder experiments demonstrate that domain knowledge matters significantly. E-commerce-adapted versions of Llama3.1 (e-Llama) and Lilium-8B show better adaptability on e-commerce tasks compared to their general counterparts, while general-domain capabilities of the text decoder also influence performance on general VLM benchmarks. Model size shows consistent benefits across general and e-commerce domains, though diminishing returns appear beyond certain thresholds—for the Fashion subset of Aspect Prediction, improvements plateau between 4B and 8B parameters.\n\nFor the Multi-Image Item Intelligence task, using all product images significantly outperforms primary image only, and fine-tuning substantially improves over zero-shot approaches. Fine-tuned Gemma3-27B achieves 52.6 F1-score with 81.2% verifiable-correct accuracy. Using bounding box cropping with GPT-4.1 re-annotation yields even better labels, with fine-tuned Gemma3-27B reaching 58.8 F1-score and 85.2% verifiable-correct accuracy. Notably, fine-tuned smaller models like Gemma3-4B achieve comparable quality to larger models while providing approximately 3.8x inference speedup.\n\n## Limitations and Conclusions\n\nThe study acknowledges several limitations: the work focuses exclusively on English, which restricts cross-lingual transfer applicability; the instruction corpus and benchmarks derive primarily from a single marketplace, creating potential distributional coupling; portions of training signals and evaluations rely on LLMs, introducing annotator and measurement noise; category coverage emphasizes fashion and high-volume verticals rather than long-tail categories; and scenarios with more than 10 images may cause out-of-memory issues.\n\nThe paper concludes that targeted VLM adaptation delivers substantial in-domain performance gains while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. The authors provide a reproducible, backbone-agnostic recipe for adapting open-weight VLMs to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy characteristics of e-commerce data. Key success factors include combining general and domain-specific training data, leveraging e-commerce-adapted language models, and using improved labeling techniques for fine-tuning.",
