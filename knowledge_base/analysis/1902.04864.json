  "summary": "# A Survey on Session-based Recommender Systems\n\nThis comprehensive survey paper, published in ACM Computing Surveys (2021), provides a systematic review of Session-based Recommender Systems (SBRSs), which have emerged as a critical paradigm for capturing short-term but dynamic user preferences in contrast to traditional recommender systems that model long-term static preferences. The authors, led by Shoujin Wang from Macquarie University, address significant gaps in the field by proposing a unified problem statement, categorizing session data characteristics and their resulting challenges, and presenting a taxonomy of SBRS approaches ranging from conventional methods to deep neural networks.\n\n## Core Concepts and Problem Statement\n\nThe fundamental distinction between SBRSs and other recommender systems lies in their approach to modeling user preferences. Traditional systems like content-based and collaborative filtering approaches rely on long-term historical interactions, assuming all past interactions equally inform current preferences—an assumption that fails in real-world scenarios where user choices depend on recent context and evolve over time. SBRSs address this by learning from sessions, defined as bounded lists of user-item interactions occurring within a continuous time period, enabling capture of both short-term preferences and dynamics reflecting preference changes across sessions.\n\nThe paper establishes formal definitions for core SBRS entities: users (who take actions on items), items (entities to recommend like products or services), actions (user interactions such as clicks or purchases), interactions (user-item-action tuples), and sessions (ordered or unordered lists of interactions). The authors define three main SBRS tasks: next interaction recommendation (predicting the next item), next partial-session recommendation (predicting remaining session items), and next session recommendation (predicting the next basket or session).\n\n## Session Data Characteristics and Challenges\n\nThe survey identifies five key properties of sessions that fundamentally shape SBRS design and performance. Session length presents challenges where long sessions contain noisy irrelevant interactions and complex dependencies, medium sessions offer balanced contextual information, and short sessions provide limited data for accurate prediction. Internal order creates distinctions between unordered sessions (relying on co-occurrence dependencies), ordered sessions (with sequential dependencies), and flexibly-ordered sessions (mixing both types).\n\nAction type introduces complexity through single-type-action sessions versus multi-type-action sessions requiring modeling of intra and inter-action dependencies. User information availability determines whether sessions are anonymous (lacking user IDs) or non-anonymous (enabling personalized long-term preference modeling across sessions). Finally, session-data structure ranges from single-level (interaction-only) to multi-level (incorporating attribute and historical session information), with each level adding predictive capability but also computational complexity.\n\n## Classification of SBRS Approaches\n\nThe authors propose a comprehensive taxonomy dividing SBRS approaches into three super-classes: conventional approaches, latent representation approaches, and deep neural network approaches. Each super-class contains multiple classes and sub-classes totaling fifteen atomic categories. Conventional approaches include pattern/rule mining (association rules and sequential patterns), K-Nearest Neighbor methods (item-KNN and session-KNN), Markov chain models, and generative probabilistic models—relatively simple methods effective on straightforward datasets but limited in handling complex dependencies.\n\nLatent representation approaches encompass latent factor models (like Factorized Personalized Markov Chains) and distributed representation methods (embedding items into low-dimensional spaces). These balance complexity and performance, efficiently encoding dependencies without deep architectures. Deep neural network approaches represent the most sophisticated category, including basic architectures (RNNs, MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and advanced models (attention mechanisms, memory networks, mixture models, generative models, and reinforcement learning).\n\nRNN-based approaches, particularly GRU4Rec and its variants, dominate the deep learning landscape due to their natural fit for sequential data modeling. GNN approaches have gained prominence for modeling complex transitions within sessions by representing sessions as graphs. Attention mechanisms enable discriminative exploitation of relevant session elements, while memory networks explicitly store and dynamically update interaction information.\n\n## Applications, Datasets, and Future Directions\n\nSBRSs apply across diverse domains including e-commerce (next-item and next-basket recommendations), media and entertainment (news, music, movie recommendations), tourism (point-of-interest recommendations), finance (trading strategy recommendations), and healthcare (treatment recommendations). The paper catalogs thirteen publicly accessible datasets commonly used for SBRS evaluation, covering domains from e-commerce to location-based services, with varying session characteristics.\n\nThe survey identifies several promising research directions: incorporating general user preferences alongside session-specific contexts, integrating contextual factors like weather and location, leveraging cross-domain information, modeling additional behavior patterns like repeat consumption, handling constraints in session generation, developing interactive recommendation frameworks, and addressing online streaming scenarios. These open issues represent the frontier of SBRS research where significant advancement is needed.\n\n*An SBRS aims to predict either the unknown part of a session given the known part, or the future session given the historical sessions via learning the intra- or inter-session dependencies.*\n\nThe paper concludes by emphasizing the flourishing nature of SBRS research and expressing hope that this survey provides readers with comprehensive understanding of key aspects, main challenges, and notable progress while illuminating pathways for future studies.",
