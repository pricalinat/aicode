  "summary": "The document presents a production-tested approach to daily price optimization for fashion e-commerce, aimed at maximizing platform revenue (and improving profitability) by selecting an optimal price point per product at scale. It proposes a three-part pipeline: predict next-day demand at a base discount, generate alternative demand estimates at nearby discount levels using product-level price elasticity, then use linear programming to choose one price option per product under constraints. The authors report live deployment and A/B tests indicating about a 1 percent revenue lift and a 0.81 percent uplift in gross margin overall.\n\nThe methodology starts with demand prediction framed as a regression problem using historical sales plus browsing clickstream signals, with extensive feature engineering to capture visibility, trends, seasonality, and competition effects. The paper highlights two practical challenges: cannibalization between substitutable products and cold-start for new items. Cannibalization is handled by modeling at category level and incorporating brand-article-gender style competitiveness features, while cold-start is addressed via product embeddings learned from user-product interactions (skip-gram style, implemented with Word2Vec) and fed into the demand model. Multiple models are evaluated (linear regression with Elastic Net, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, LSTM, ARIMA), with an ensemble approach chosen that takes the median of several regressors outputs.\n\nAfter predicting demand for each product at its base discount, the paper uses price elasticity of demand to estimate demand at two additional price points created by adjusting the base discount by plus or minus a small guardrail delta. Elasticity is computed at the individual product level from historical price-demand pairs because elasticity varies widely across items and can include atypical cases like Veblen-type behavior; for new products, elasticity is borrowed from similar products identified through embeddings. This produces three price-demand options per product, which would otherwise yield an intractable number of combinations across millions of products, so the selection is formulated as an optimization problem and solved via linear programming with a relaxed constraint (continuous selection variables between 0 and 1). The implementation uses SciPy linprog with a vectorized representation where each product corresponds to a set of three columns (discount minus delta, base, discount plus delta) and constraints enforce one choice per product plus a global price-sum constraint controlled by a parameter c.\n\nResults and analysis emphasize the heavy-tailed nature of demand and revenue contribution: a small fraction of products drives most revenue, while quantity sold is often zero, which influences metric choice. The paper uses MAE and RMSE for evaluation and argues that R2 is not suitable given the label distribution. In model comparisons on three months of training data and a recent day for testing, the ensemble of regressors performs best among the tested approaches, while LSTM and ARIMA underperform in this business context due to weak sequential structure amid external factors.\n\n*Overall there was an approximately 1% increase in revenue of the platform and 0.81% uplift in gross margin due to model recommended prices.*\n\n*Typically fashion e-commerce has millions of products, so there can be many permutations.*",
