  "summary": "This paper surveys the shift in recommender systems research from an accuracy-first mindset toward trustworthy recommender systems, motivated by real-world threats like attacks, noisy and fake information, privacy risks, and systemic bias. It defines a trustworthy recommender system as one stakeholders can rely on to be accurate and also robust, fair, transparent, explainable, privacy-preserving, and responsible, arguing that trustworthiness can matter more than accuracy in sensitive domains such as finance and medicine. The authors position their contribution as a high-level conceptual overview that also introduces unifying concepts and a framework, not just a catalog of prior techniques.\n\nA central idea is the trustworthy recommendation ecosystem, which broadens the focus beyond models to include trustworthy users, items, and providers alongside the recommender system itself. The paper then organizes trustworthiness into multiple aspects, emphasizing both technical properties and human factors, including: robustness, fairness, transparency, explainability, privacy and security, responsibility, human perception of trustworthiness, trustworthiness integration across aspects, and trustworthy evaluation methods. *Accuracy should not be the only focus of an RS and trustworthiness must be prioritised.* *To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the proposal of an ethical evaluation of RSs is put forward in the literature.*\n\nThe authors present a four-stage perspective for building trustworthy systems across the full recommendation pipeline: (1) trustworthy data preparation that cleans noise, fake signals, and bias while protecting privacy, (2) robust and explainable representation learning that remains stable under attack and yields interpretable representations, (3) recommendation generation that is fair, transparent, explainable, and responsible, and (4) trustworthy evaluation that explicitly combines technical evaluation with ethical evaluation of responsibility and social impact. For each stage they outline key challenges and example strategy families, such as data cleaning and debiasing (including counterfactual and contrastive augmentation), federated learning and decentralization for privacy, adversarial and denoising approaches for robustness, transparency-oriented modeling and result explanations, and new protocols and metrics to assess trustworthiness beyond conventional accuracy-oriented offline tests. The paper concludes with future directions, notably truly integrated multi-aspect systems, human-centered trustworthiness grounded in stakeholder perception, ecosystem-level trust (items and providers), multi-granular fairness, finer personalization that serves minority users better, responsible recommendation as a socio-technical goal, and the need for stronger technical and ethical evaluation methods.",
