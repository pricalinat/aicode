  "summary": "This survey reviews modern recommender systems tailored to fashion and garments, arguing that the domain’s fast turnover, sparse purchase signals, subjective aesthetics, and fit uncertainty make generic recommenders insufficient. It contributes a taxonomy that organizes prior work by task goals and by the kinds of side information used, then connects these choices to evaluation goals, perspectives, datasets, and common metrics. *We have identified the most pressing challenges in fashion RS research and created a taxonomy that categorizes the literature according to the objective they are trying to accomplish.*\n\nOn tasks, the paper separates fashion recommendation into item recommendation, pair and outfit recommendation including outfit composition and fill in the blank settings, size and fit recommendation, and explanation generation, plus emerging areas like trend forecasting and fashion image generation. On inputs, it distinguishes collaborative filtering from hybrid and context-aware approaches, highlighting item side information from images and text as central for representing color, texture, brand, attributes, and style, and user side information from social platforms and body related signals for personalization and fit. Key challenges emphasized include learning robust item representations from multimodal content, modeling compatibility that shifts with trends and context, integrating personalization factors like season, occasion, location and culture, and producing accountable explanations via visual regions, attributes, or comparisons to a user’s history. *Fit prediction is a pain point for online fashion shopping according to customers, and the primary reason for product returns faced by online retailers.*\n\nOn algorithms, the survey focuses on visually aware model-based collaborative filtering extensions and generative approaches. It discusses VBPR and successors that incorporate image features into ranking models, variants that better separate style from category, attention-based collaborative filtering that weights multimedia components, and end to end models that learn visual embeddings directly for recommendation. It also summarizes GAN inspired methods used for complementary item feature transformation and for generating compatible items or full outfits, and notes other families used across the literature such as graph models, Siamese networks, RNN and transformer style architectures, and knowledge graph based methods for structure and cold start mitigation.\n\nEvaluation is framed by goals such as outfit generation, outfit recommendation, pair recommendation, fill in the blank, and outfit compatibility prediction, plus perspectives beyond accuracy including explanation quality, generated image quality and diversity, and social impacts like bias and fairness. The paper catalogs widely used datasets such as Amazon Reviews, DeepFashion, Fashion IQ, Polyvore, IQON3000, and several proprietary or non public collections, and highlights reproducibility hurdles because many datasets are unavailable or heterogeneous. In its conclusions and outlook, it calls for better dataset design, deeper understanding of what visual models truly learn, and more work on forecasting, ethics, adversarial robustness and privacy, deployability at scale, multimodal and cross-modal representations including CLIP-like models, interactive multimodal recommendation, virtual try on, and causal interpretability, with an added note that large language models are increasingly relevant for fashion recommendation workflows.",
