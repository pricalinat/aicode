  "summary": "# Understanding Privacy Over-collection in WeChat Sub-app Ecosystem\n\nThis paper presents the first systematic study of privacy over-collection in WeChat's sub-app ecosystem, where sub-apps collect more personal data than they disclose in their privacy policies. The researchers developed SPOChecker, an automated framework combining static analysis, dynamic testing, and natural language processing to detect privacy over-collection across 5,521 popular WeChat sub-apps.\n\n## Key Findings on Privacy Over-collection\n\nThe study reveals significant privacy concerns in the WeChat sub-app ecosystem. Only 45.48% of sub-apps provide valid privacy policies, meaning the majority operate without clear privacy disclosures. Among the 2,511 sub-apps that do provide privacy policies, 19.47% (489 sub-apps) contain privacy over-collection, collecting 781 privacy items without user disclosure. When including sub-apps without privacy policies, the overall over-collection rate jumps dramatically from 15.65% to 54.03%.\n\nThe research identified 37 privacy items across three categories: device privacy accessed through system APIs (location, camera, Bluetooth), platform privacy unique to the super-app environment (WeChat contacts, friend lists), and user-input privacy collected through UI interactions (identity information, health data, financial details). Platform privacy shows the lowest over-collection rate at 3.2%, while device and user-input privacy both exhibit rates around 16%, suggesting these more diverse and less regulated categories are more prone to over-collection.\n\n## Root Causes and Stakeholder Accountability\n\nThe authors identified three objective reasons for privacy over-collection: vague policy statements that use generic language like \"personal information such as name, ID\" without specificity; developer unawareness of privacy risks embedded in certain APIs (Bluetooth UUIDs can reveal location, screenshots may leak system information); and perception evolution as privacy norms change over time. Some privacy items showed particularly high over-collection rates, with Bluetooth at 85.71% and clipboard data at 84.91%.\n\nTemplates and SDKs emerged as significant contributors to the problem. Nearly a quarter of sub-apps (23.7%) are generated from just 272 templates, and 62.1% use 307 distinct SDKs. Template-generated sub-apps collect an average of 3.00 privacy items compared to 1.69 for non-templates, with corresponding higher over-collection rates. SDKs, despite comprising only 2.93% of code, account for 14.97% of privacy collection and 7.95% of over-collection, indicating outsized privacy risk from third-party components.\n\n## Defense Mechanisms and Limitations\n\nCurrent WeChat privacy protections prove inadequate. Only 43 of 125 privacy-collecting subAPIs (34.4%) require explicit user permission, leaving most device privacy unprotected. The privacy protection guidelines rely on developer self-reporting that is not rigorously audited—5.18% of sub-apps submit completely blank guidelines. Privacy items with no protection show a 17.48% over-collection rate, partially protected items show 12.04%, and fully protected items only 3.09%, demonstrating that existing mechanisms work but fail to cover sufficient privacy categories.\n\nThe research opens new directions for understanding privacy risks in app-in-app ecosystems. SPOChecker itself has limitations: static analysis cannot track complex multi-process data transmissions, and the tool focuses on text-based UI components, potentially missing privacy collection through non-text elements like gender selection toggles. The methodology can likely transfer to similar platforms like Line or Alipay that use comparable Web-based sub-app architectures.",
