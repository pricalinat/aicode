  "summary": "# Summary: Inventory Management Under Stochastic Demand\n\nThis research paper by Sarit Maitra presents a comprehensive simulation-optimization approach for managing inventory under stochastic demand conditions. The study addresses a critical challenge in supply chain management: balancing inventory levels to maximize profits while minimizing stockouts and excessive holding costs when demand is unpredictable.\n\n## Research Context and Problem Statement\n\nThe study emerges from the reality that U.S. business logistics costs reached a record $2.3 trillion in 2023, representing approximately 9% of US GDP. Inventory management has evolved into a strategic function that directly impacts organizational performance, yet traditional optimization approaches struggle with the uncertain, dynamic nature of real-world demand patterns. The research focuses on a case study involving four highly customized products with unique customer demands, making them particularly unpredictable with seasonality and latent trends.\n\nThe core problem addressed is determining optimal inventory policies—specifically how much to order and when to order—under conditions where demand follows stochastic rather than deterministic patterns. The paper argues that conventional analytical models are impractical in supply chain settings due to inherent business uncertainties, making simulation-based approaches essential.\n\n## Methodology and Technical Framework\n\nThe research combines Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) with two inventory policies: periodic review (p, Q) and continuous review (r, Q). The (p, Q) policy places orders at fixed intervals, while the (r, Q) policy dynamically triggers orders when inventory falls below a predetermined reorder point. The simulation framework uses historical demand data to generate random samples based on probability distributions, incorporating both random sampling and conditional sampling techniques.\n\nThe mathematical formulation captures daily inventory dynamics through equations tracking sales, inventory levels, and profit calculation over 365-day periods. Key metrics include average profit (μprofit), reorder quantity (r), order quantity (Q), average safety stock (μSS), and standard deviation of profit (σprofit). The profit function subtracts holding costs, ordering costs, and purchase costs from revenue generated by sales.\n\nThe study employs both grid search and Bayesian optimization to identify optimal reorder quantities and points. Grid search evaluates profitability across combinations of Q and r values incremented by 10, while Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to find optimal solutions more efficiently.\n\n## Key Findings and Results\n\nThe empirical analysis reveals significant performance differences between inventory policies. The (r, Q) policy substantially outperforms the (p, Q) policy, generating an expected profit of 3,274,304.64 compared to 1,703,934.7—a near doubling of profitability. This improvement stems from the continuous review system's ability to dynamically adapt to daily demand fluctuations and lead time considerations.\n\nRegarding sampling methods, random sampling yields slightly higher total profits (1,703,934.7) than conditional sampling (1,615,108.92), though conditional sampling executes notably faster (3,656.68 seconds versus 4,527.05 seconds). The trade-off between execution speed and profitability suggests conditional sampling may be suitable for time-sensitive applications where minor profit sacrifices are acceptable.\n\nThe optimization comparison shows Bayesian optimization achieving a total profit of 3,884,802.49 versus grid search at 3,866,345.03, representing a marginal improvement of approximately 0.5%. However, Bayesian optimization presents a potentially riskier strategy with higher standard deviation in profit outcomes. The study notes that grid search remains valuable for its interpretability and straightforward approach to identifying optimal parameters.\n\nOverall optimization improved profits by 18.64% over baseline policies, demonstrating the substantial value of systematic simulation-optimization approaches in inventory management.\n\n## Implications and Limitations\n\nThe research provides several practical contributions for inventory managers. The open-source Python implementation enables practitioners to adapt the framework to their specific contexts. The findings strongly support continuous review systems for stochastic demand environments, where dynamic inventory management can significantly reduce stockout risks and excess inventory while improving profitability.\n\nHowever, the study acknowledges important limitations. The model assumes deterministic lead times, log-normal demand distributions, and excludes certain costs such as storage, handling, and stockout penalties. The simulation is computationally expensive due to the numerous iterations required to eliminate noise in results. Additionally, the approach considers only present inventory levels without incorporating demand forecasts or other complex factors that might inform real-world decisions.\n\nFuture research should incorporate more complex environmental factors and explore alternative advanced optimization techniques to further improve inventory management under uncertainty.\n\n*Using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) combined with random and conditional sampling techniques, the (r, Q) policy dynamically places orders based on inventory levels, significantly outperforming the fixed-interval (p, Q) approach.*",
