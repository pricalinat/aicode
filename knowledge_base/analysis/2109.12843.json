It frames recommender systems through a four-part taxonomy: stage in the industrial pipeline (matching, ranking, re-ranking), scenario (such as social, sequential, session-based, cross-domain, multi-behavior, bundle), objective (accuracy plus beyond-accuracy goals like diversity, explainability, fairness), and application domains (e-commerce, POI, news, movies, etc.). On the GNN side, it reviews graph construction types (homogeneous, heterogeneous, hypergraph) and core design families (spectral vs spatial), then connects these building blocks to recommendation tasks primarily through message passing and multi-hop neighborhood aggregation.\n\nA central argument is that GNNs help recommendation because they unify diverse relational signals as graphs, capture high-order connectivity that classical CF and many neural recommenders only model implicitly, and can exploit additional supervision signals such as auxiliary behaviors or self-supervised objectives. The survey highlights four recurring implementation challenges: (1) graph construction choices for nodes and edges (including handling density, feature discretization, and relation typing), (2) propagation and aggregation design (paths, weighting, aggregation operators, depth vs over-smoothing), (3) optimization (losses like point-wise vs pair-wise, negative sampling tied to graph structure, and multi-task balancing), and (4) computation efficiency (scalability and latency constraints in real-world serving). It emphasizes that many design decisions trade off recommendation quality against cost, especially in large graphs and in ranking settings with many feature fields.\n\nMost of the paper is a structured overview of existing methods mapped onto the taxonomy. For stages, it distinguishes GNNs for matching that focus on efficient high-order CF signal extraction on user-item or item-item graphs (including simplifications like removing nonlinearities and using sampling), GNNs for ranking that use graphs to model feature interactions via encoders plus predictors, and early re-ranking work that uses GNNs to integrate item relationships and personalization when optimizing beyond relevance. For scenarios, it surveys how social recommendation combines user-user social graphs with user-item interaction graphs (with GCN vs attention based weighting, plus hypergraph or motif variants for higher-order social structure), how sequential and session-based recommendation convert sequences to item transition graphs and often still rely on separate sequence models, how bundle recommendation uses tripartite or hierarchical graphs to represent bundle-item affiliation, how cross-domain methods transfer signals through shared users/items or heterogeneous cross-domain graphs, and how multi-behavior recommendation models different edge types and their varying influence using weights, behavior representations, or knowledge-enhanced mechanisms. For objectives, it summarizes GNN approaches to diversity (individual-level and system-level, often via graph augmentation, rebalanced sampling, or auxiliary losses), explainability (largely via knowledge graphs and path or attention based rationales), and fairness (typically via fair graph embedding or adversarial debiasing, often with some performance trade-off).\n\n*We then systematically analyze the challenges in graph construction, embedding propagation aggregation, model optimization, and computation efficiency.*\n\n*GNN-based methods have become the new state-of-the-art approaches in recommender systems.*",
