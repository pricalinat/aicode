  "summary": "# Summary: Fairness and Diversity in Recommender Systems\n\nThis survey paper explores the critical beyond-utility perspectives of fairness and diversity in recommender systems (RS), examining both domains individually and their intrinsic connections. The authors argue that while traditional RS focus on utility metrics like recall and click-through rate, solely pursuing these goals leads to practical issues such as the Matthew Effect (where popular items become even more popular) and filter bubbles (where users only see similar content). The paper proposes a novel categorization of user-level diversity, expanding the conventional item-focused diversity research, and reinterprets fairness studies through a diversity lens to reveal potential future research directions.\n\nThe paper establishes foundational concepts for both fairness and diversity in recommender systems. Fairness is examined at two levels: item-level fairness addresses exposure disparities between popular and unpopular items (popularity bias), while user-level fairness ensures equitable treatment across different user groups based on sensitive features or quality discrepancies. The authors categorize debiasing methods into pre-processing (adjusting training data), in-processing (incorporating fairness during training via regularization or adversarial learning), and post-processing (re-ranking recommendations). For diversity, the paper distinguishes between individual diversity (measuring variety within a single recommendation list using distance-based or category-based metrics) and aggregate diversity (measuring variety across all recommendations system-wide using metrics like Shannon Entropy and Gini Index).\n\nA key contribution of this survey is the exploration of the fairness-diversity connection at both item and user levels. At the item level, improving exposure fairness by recommending more unpopular items typically increases aggregate diversity. At the user level, the authors introduce a novel framework categorizing user diversity into four types: explicit/implicit features, historical preferences (proportionality), fairness requirements, and multiple interests. This expanded perspective allows reinterpretation of existing fairness works from a diversity viewpoint—for example, calibration-based fairness (ensuring recommended item genres match user history) connects to historical preference diversity, while personalized fairness addresses users' varying fairness tolerances.\n\nThe authors empirically investigate the relationship between fairness and diversity using MovieLens data, demonstrating that methods improving item fairness also increase aggregate diversity, and that individual diversity enhancement can positively impact item fairness. The survey concludes by outlining significant challenges and opportunities, including understanding the mathematical relationships between fairness and diversity metrics, developing multi-objective optimization approaches that balance competing objectives, exploring intersections with other beyond-utility perspectives like explainability, and addressing fairness and diversity in dynamic settings where user preferences and item distributions evolve over time.",
