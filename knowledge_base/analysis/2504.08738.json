  "summary": "The paper proposes an AI-driven sentiment analytics system tailored to e-commerce feedback, aiming to turn high-volume, nuanced customer text into actionable business signals while keeping decisions interpretable. It argues traditional lexicon and static ML approaches struggle with context, sarcasm, domain jargon, multi-aspect opinions, and real-time demands, so it uses a hybrid design that combines deep learning accuracy with more transparent components. *Experimental results show that our system outperforms standard sentiment analysis methods, achieving an accuracy of 89.7% on diverse, large-scale datasets.*\n\nMethodologically, it presents a modular, end-to-end pipeline and a transformer-centered model: a modified BERT core with domain embedding and a custom attention mechanism using domain-specific masks, plus ensemble and multi-task elements for classification and aspect-based sentiment. The system is described as having layers for data ingestion and preprocessing, analysis and classification, and insights generation, including trend detection, reporting, and alerts for negative sentiment spikes. Experiments use three e-commerce datasets, Amazon Product Reviews, E-commerce Customer Feedback, and Multi-aspect Product Sentiment, report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1, and compare against LSTM, BERT, RoBERTa, and LLM baselines such as GPT-3.5, Claude-3, and Llama-2; results show the proposed approach is competitive on all three datasets and particularly strong on aspect performance like product quality, while also emphasizing latency and size trade-offs versus LLMs.\n\nBeyond model metrics, the paper claims measurable operational and financial impact from deployments: faster responses to negative feedback, improved satisfaction, higher conversion from neutral to positive reviews, and reduced churn, supported by two case studies including a large marketplace and a specialty luxury retailer. *45% improvement in customer issue resolution time.* It also highlights limitations such as resource requirements, difficulties with highly domain-specific terminology, and limited multilingual support, and outlines future work on multilingual expansion, stronger aspect handling for implicit and comparative sentiment, scalability testing, error and ablation studies, multimodal inputs, and predictive analytics. Ethical considerations focus on privacy, security, and bias, citing GDPR-compliant handling, fairness audits, and potential privacy-preserving approaches such as federated learning.",
