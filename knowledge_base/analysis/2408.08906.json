  "summary": "# BunCa: Bundle Recommendation with Item-level Causation-enhanced Multi-view Learning\n\n## Overview\n\nThis paper introduces BunCa, a novel neural architecture for bundle recommendation that leverages asymmetric item relationships through multi-view learning. The research addresses a critical limitation in existing bundle recommendation systems: they typically rely on symmetric correlations between items, failing to capture the directional influence that items have on each other within bundles.\n\n## Problem and Motivation\n\nBundle recommendation involves suggesting sets of interconnected items—such as complementary products or items from the same category—to enhance business profitability and user convenience. Unlike traditional item recommendation, bundle recommendation faces greater challenges due to data sparsity and diverse bundle compositions.\n\nThe authors observe that in real-world scenarios, the influence between items within bundles is asymmetric. For example, a user interested in blazers might consider adding cravats as accessories, while users primarily interested in cravats might already own suitable blazers and prefer pocket squares instead. This asymmetric relationship is crucial for understanding user preferences, yet existing methods overlook it.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\nBunCa employs a dual-view architecture that combines two distinct learning perspectives. The Cohesive View utilizes LightGCN for information propagation among users and bundles, capturing high-order collaborative signals through user-bundle interactions. The Coherent View incorporates the Multi-Prospect Causation Network (MPCNet) to model causation-sensitive relationships among items, generating enhanced representations that reflect the asymmetric influence between bundle components.\n\nThe model constructs item-item relationships from two sub-views: the User Preference (UP) sub-view derived from user-item interactions, and the Bundle Construction (BC) sub-view derived from bundle-item affiliations. MPCNet uses multiple learnable prospect vectors to capture different aspects of item influence, with attention mechanisms computing asymmetric causation matrices that indicate how much each item is influenced by others.\n\nAdditionally, BunCa integrates both discrete and concrete contrastive learning. Discrete contrastive learning minimizes inconsistencies between the two views, while concrete contrastive learning enhances the distinctiveness of fused multi-view representations for individual users and bundles.\n\n## Experimental Results\n\nThe researchers conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets: Youshu (book bundles), NetEase (music playlists), and iFashion (outfit recommendations). BunCa achieved state-of-the-art performance across all datasets, with particularly notable improvements on iFashion—8.25% to 9.57% improvement over the second-best model.\n\nAblation studies validated the importance of each component. Removing the Coherent View caused performance drops of 10-62% depending on the dataset, while removing contrastive learning modules resulted in 35-59% decreases. The asymmetric causation matrix proved essential, as replacing it with symmetric alternatives significantly degraded performance.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nThe analysis revealed important insights about bundle characteristics. In iFashion, bundles typically contain one or two key anchor items that strongly influence other items, making asymmetric relationships highly valuable. Conversely, in NetEase and Youshu where bundles are larger, many items show high-level influence, introducing noise that partially diminishes the benefits of asymmetric modeling.\n\nThe qualitative examples from iFashion demonstrate how BunCa identifies anchor items within bundles—for instance, in a bundle containing a shirt and earrings, the shirt serves as the anchor with an influence weight of 1.0 on the earrings, while the reverse influence is only 0.1.\n\n## Contributions\n\nThis work makes three primary contributions: it provides the first comprehensive study exploring asymmetric item relationships in bundle recommendation; it introduces a multi-view learning framework combining Cohesive and Coherent Views with discrete and concrete contrastive learning; and it demonstrates through extensive experiments that modeling asymmetric causation significantly improves bundle recommendation quality, particularly for fashion-style bundles with coherent item combinations.",
