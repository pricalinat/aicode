  "summary": "# ProMoAI: Process Modeling with Generative AI\n\nProMoAI is a novel tool developed by researchers at Fraunhofer Institute and RWTH Aachen University that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate process models from textual descriptions. The system represents a significant advancement in making process modeling accessible to non-experts by eliminating the need for deep technical knowledge in process modeling languages.\n\n## Core Functionality and Architecture\n\nThe tool accepts natural language descriptions of business processes and transforms them into formal process models using sophisticated prompt engineering techniques. Users can select their preferred LLM (currently OpenAI models), provide an API key, and enter a textual description of the process they want to model. The system then generates Python code that utilizes a predefined set of functions designed specifically for safe POWL model generation, executes this code in a secure environment, and produces the final process model.\n\nProMoAI employs several advanced techniques to ensure high-quality outputs. It uses role prompting to establish the LLM as an expert in process modeling, provides a comprehensive knowledge base about POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language), incorporates least-to-most prompting for recursive model generation, applies self-evaluation instructions to avoid common mistakes, and utilizes few-shot learning with concrete examples from the PET dataset.\n\n## POWL and Process Model Generation\n\nThe system uses POWL as its intermediate representation, which is a subclass of Petri nets that allows for the generation of block-structured models where submodels are combined hierarchically. POWL provides inherent quality guarantees that prevent generating models with dead parts that can never be reached. The language assumes every task is concurrent by default unless explicitly constrained, which aligns with the inherent nature of many real-world processes and facilitates direct translation of natural language statements into POWL models.\n\nGenerated POWL models are automatically transformed into widely-recognized process modeling notations including BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) and Petri nets. Users can view and export models in these standard formats, making integration with existing business process management tools straightforward.\n\n## Error Handling and Interactive Refinement\n\nProMoAI features a robust error-handling mechanism that utilizes self-evaluation and refinement capabilities of LLMs through iterative prompting. When errors occur during code execution due to validation rule violations, the system produces informative feedback messages that are incorporated into the conversation history with the LLM, enabling refinement of the generated code.\n\nA key feature is the interactive refinement loop that allows users to provide feedback on generated process models. The system uses this feedback to generate refinement prompts integrated into the conversation history, enabling iterative improvement until the model accurately meets user requirements.\n\n## Example Application\n\nThe paper demonstrates ProMoAI's capabilities using an online shopping process that includes typical process constructs such as choice, loop, concurrency, and sequence, as well as more complex non-hierarchical dependencies between selecting items, setting payment methods, reward selection, and payment choices. The generated BPMN model conforms to the reference process model and correctly integrates user feedback requests. The example shows that POWL can detect structures that traditional hierarchical process modeling notations like process trees fail to represent.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nThe researchers plan to extend ProMoAI by supporting additional LLM providers beyond OpenAI, including Google Gemini. They are also exploring direct BPMN generation from textual descriptions without the intermediate POWL representation, which would offer more flexibility in representing complex process structures though it would require developing more advanced generation and validation techniques to maintain model quality.",
