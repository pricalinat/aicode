  "summary": "This MSc thesis documents the development of an AI-based chatbot system for AK Traders London LTD, a taxi company. The project aimed to improve customer experience by implementing a virtual agent capable of processing customer enquiries through natural language. The primary objectives included building a chatbot that could handle complex questions, provide logical responses, and operate 24/7 to assist customers with inquiries about pricing, driver locations, and other company services.\n\nThe research began with a comprehensive literature review examining various chatbot technologies, including NLP techniques, vector space models, and machine learning approaches. The author analyzed different chatbot categories—open-domain versus closed-domain, and retrieval-based versus generative-based systems. After evaluating multiple options, the project selected machine learning technology using the Python ChatterBot library, which offers language independence, ease of conversation updates, and the ability to add multiple topics without restrictions. *The chatbot system works by receiving user input, saving it in a library, processing it, and generating responses based on previously learned conversations.*\n\nThe methodology employed the Waterfall model for system development, progressing through sequential phases: requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Data collection involved interviews with existing customers and surveys distributed to 25 participants aged 19-63 using SurveyMonkey. Survey findings revealed that 34% of users struggled with website navigation, 31% couldn't get answers to simple questions, and 64% valued the 24/7 availability that chatbot systems could provide. *Most participants preferred chatbots for instant solutions while still wanting human assistance for complex queries.*\n\nThe implementation utilized Python with the ChatterBot library, trained through both list-based data and corpus training methods. The system was integrated into the company's website using Django as the web framework. Custom YAML files were created to train the chatbot with company-specific question-answer pairs covering approximately 150 questions related to taxi services.\n\nTesting encompassed white box testing (code analysis and debugging), black box testing (functional verification), and stress testing (performance under load). The chatbot successfully responded to trained queries but struggled with unknown inputs, producing unexpected responses when questions did not match the training data. A character limit of 5000 was identified during stress testing.\n\nThe project's limitations included insufficient training data for comprehensive coverage, inability to perform spelling correction, lack of anaphora resolution for referring to previous questions, and response times averaging 15 seconds. Future recommendations suggested expanding the question-answer datasets, implementing hand-coded rules for common queries, combining NLP with vector space models for improved accuracy, and enhancing the system to engage in conversational interactions rather than simple question-answer exchanges.",
